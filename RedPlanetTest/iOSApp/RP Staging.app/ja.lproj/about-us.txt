With hotels in central locations in Indonesia, Japan, the Philippines and Thailand our hotels have recently undergone a transformation to make travel more accessible to our valued guests.

We have transformed the value hotel sector by offering an all-inclusive rate for every room, every night.

You can rest assured on that.

All rooms have free high-speed Wi-Fi so you can stay wired at all times, our high-powered showers are always a hit, our quality custom-made beds with upscale linen provide a comfortable night's sleep

There are many other features including air conditioning, in-room safes, hair dryers, ceiling fans and large flat screen televisions.

There are no hidden costs in the room rates or the amenities we provide.

We look forward to welcoming you soon.

And donâ€™t forget to join our loyalty programme - Remembered - for great discounts on room rates and other cool benefits.
